- 👋 Hi, I’m @dlivelyapps4all
- 👀 I’m interested in security and privacy for everyone. I'm also interested in learning all aspects of coding. I'm interested in finding people who are willing to help me grow and learn to be able to make resources available to those who can't afford much and to help everyone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android development I'm not very experienced. I'm learning on my own from anything I can find. So any advice or resource would be greatly appreciated!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that has to do with improving one's life in anyway and that helps improving people's privacy and the security of internet in every aspect.
- 📫 How to reach me you can get a hold of me here or you can email me at dliveapps4allu@gmail.com or at https://t.me/Dliveapps4allu
